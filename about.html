<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Aspiring full stack web developer.  I went to PTC for IT with a concentration in Digital Security and forensics.
  Since I was youn technology has always interested me.  I have learned that with my ability to adapt quickly to new
  technologies and systems, I found a passion in this field.  This quality matched with my unforgiving attitude of persistance
  towards solving problems, critical thinking, and creating solutions has lead me to great achievements.
</p>

<p>I worked at a software development company that specialized in a product for hospitals and outpatient centers for
  5 years.  Within my time at this company I started off as an intern as Level 1 Technical Support Engineer and worked my
  way up through 2 promotions.  First being a Technical Account Manager, and next a Team Lead for the department I "grew
  up in" there.  Which was the Technical Support Department.  As a Technical Account Manager I managed 5 of some of our
  largest clients.  I assited with ensuring quality support was being shown, projects were moving accordingly, and customer
  satisfaction was at the utmost priority.  I collaborated with multiple departments within the company and developed many
  new relationships with some really great and knowledgeable people.  People I still call friends to this day.
  <br />
  I then was offered the opportunity to come back down to the department I started in, and lead the team.  This was my
  my favorit position while here.  I loved the ability to support my fellow peers with their work and provide the knowledge
  that I had within our product.  One of my favorite qualities of life is being able to help others and watch them grow.  I 
  not only worked with my peers daily, but also the management team and director.  I gained a lot of important skills in regards
  to management and I am still able to practice and apply them to this day.</p>

<p>I now work with my father in a totally separate field.  He started a company that is in the field of logisitcs.  I am the operations
  manager of the company.  I manage operations on multiple levels.  Starting with day to day fleet and delivery commitments, HR related
  work, and managing a staff of more than 90 people.  I have a leadership team under me (dispatch), and they oversee the drivers each day
  that report to work.  The lessons I learned in my previous career have definitely transferred to this role, however, this brings me to
  why I am even getting into full stack development.  I found that I miss the problem solving and working around technologies.  
  I don't have the bandwith of having this role and also going back into another tech role somewhere, so I have found a new idea/goal that
  has inspired me to learn code: front to back.  My goal outside of my role here is to create a web application that houses an overall
  ability to review and manage all operations from a central location.  Right now I have mutliple excel files, an access database, and folder
  directories everywhere and nowhere.  I am determined to build this application, and scale it to provide a really great tool for other similar
  businesses in this field.
